			<p>
				Generic Character Sheet Builder is a tool designed to make
				playing indie RPGs virtually more accessible, as most such rpgs
				do not have dedicated online tooling. This aims to fill in this
				gap, permitting one to create character sheet templates for any
				RPG, which work kinda like form-fill pdfs, except without all
				the jank that form-fill pdfs are known for.
