# GenCS - Generic Character Sheets

Work-in-progress TTRPG character sheet builder, using MERN.

Designed to be system agnostic, providing a online character-sheet hosting
solution for all the indie TTRPGs that don't have enough players to get
proper online tools.

## Scope:

### Main functionality:

- Character sheet custom template creator/editor
- Character sheet creator/editor (from template)
- Character sheet/template library
- Sharing character sheets & templates with permalinks
    - Supports unlisted and private
- Cloning character sheet templates

### Scope-creep functionality:

- Discovery tools (like searching, maybe a like system) for public character sheet templates
- Sharing character sheet ownership with multiple users (for GMs)
- Live-modification of character sheet details (i.e. for things like current hit points)

### Things explicitely outside the scope of this project:

- Auto-calculations
- RPG Virtual Tabletop integrations
